Other Non-Functional Requirements
================================

Performance Requirements
------------------------

*If there are performance requirements for the product under various circumstances,
state them here and explain their rationale, to help the developers understand the
intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the timing relationships for real
time systems. Make such requirements as specific as possible. You may need to state
performance requirements for individual functional requirements or features.*

Safety Requirements
-------------------

*Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or harm
that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or actions that
must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented. Refer to any external
policies or regulations that state safety issues that affect the product’s design or
use. Define any safety certifications that must be satisfied.*

Security Requirements
---------------------

*Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use of
the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define any user
identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or regulations
containing security issues that affect the product. Define any security or privacy
certifications that must be satisfied.*

Software Quality Attributes
---------------------------

*Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be important
to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: adaptability,
availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, maintainability, portability,
reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, and usability. Write these to be
specific, quantitative, and verifiable when possible. At the least, clarify the
relative preferences for various attributes, such as ease of use over ease of learning.*

Business Rules
--------------

*List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or roles
can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not functional
requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional requirements to
enforce the rules.*
