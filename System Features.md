System Features
===============
*This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements
for the product by system features, the major services provided by
the product. You may prefer to organize this section by use case,
mode of operation, user class, object class, functional hierarchy,
or combinations of these, whatever makes the most logical sense for
your product.*

System Feature 1
----------------
*Don't really say "System Feature 1." State the feature name in just
a few words.*

### Description and Priority
*Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is
of High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority
component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on
a relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).*

### Stimulus/Response Sequences
*List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the
behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog
elements associated with use cases.*

### Functional Requirements
*Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature.
These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the
user to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the
use case. Include how the product should respond to anticipated error
conditions or invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete,
unambiguous, verifiable, and necessary. Use "TBD" as a placeholder to
indicate when necessary information is not yet available.*

*Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a
meaningful tag of some kind.*
