Overall Description
===================

Product Perspective
-------------------
*Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product
family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained
product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements
of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces
between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall
system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.*

Product Functions
-----------------
*Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform.
Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet
list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any
reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they
relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often
effective.*

User Classes and Characteristics
--------------------------------
*Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User
classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions
used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or
experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain
requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important
user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.*

Operating Environment
---------------------
*Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware
platform, operating system and versions, and any other software components or
applications with which it must peacefully coexist.*

Design and Implementation Constraints
-------------------------------------
*Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers.
These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing
requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific
technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language
requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions
or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s organization will be
responsible for maintaining the delivered software).*

User Documentation
------------------
*List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and
tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user
documentation delivery formats or standards.*

Assumptions and Dependencies
----------------------------
*List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial
components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating
environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions
are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the
project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to
reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).*
