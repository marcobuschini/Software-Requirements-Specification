External Interface Requirements
===============================

User Interfaces
---------------
*Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software
product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards
or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints,
standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen,
keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Define the
software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of the user
interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.*

Hardware Interfaces
-------------------
*Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the
software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the
supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between
the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.*

Software Interfaces
-------------------
*Describe the connections between this product and other specific software
components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools,
libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or
messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each.
Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents
that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data
that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must
be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a
multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.*

Communications Interfaces
-------------------------
*Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions required
by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server communications
protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent message formatting.
Identify any communication standards that will be used, such as FTP or HTTP.
Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data transfer rates,
and synchronization mechanisms.*
