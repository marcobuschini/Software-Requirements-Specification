Introduction
============

Purpose
-------
*Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document,
including the revision or release number. Describe the scope of the product that is
covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or
a single subsystem.*

Document Conventions
--------------------
*Describe any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when writing
this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special significance. For example,
state whether priorities  for higher-level requirements are assumed to be inherited
by detailed requirements, or whether every requirement statement is to have its own
priority.*

Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
-----------------------------------------
*Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as
developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation
writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. Suggest
a sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and
proceeding through the sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.*

Product Scope
-------------
*Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose,
including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate
goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available,
refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.*

References
----------
*List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may
include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements
specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough
information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title,
author, version number, date, and source or location.*
